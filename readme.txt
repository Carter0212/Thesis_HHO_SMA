I have done the original version of SMA like in paper. (OriginalSMA in file: SMA.py)
I also created new my modified of SMA - faster and better (BaseSMA in file: SMA.py)

The root.py file contain some useful helper functions which used in SMA.py file.
Run the test_SMA.py by:
	python test_SMA.py

You need libraries:
	python >= 3.7.6
	numpy >= 1.18.1
